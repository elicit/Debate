## Debate 1

Question:

A defendant was suspected of having burglarized his neighbor's apartment. The neighbor reported that his apartment had been ransacked and several items of clothing had been stolen. During the course of their investigation, two police detectives went to the defendant's place of work to interview him. After being advised of his Miranda rights, the defendant requested permission to call his attorney. Although his attorney was unavailable, the attorney's receptionist admonished him not to say anything. The defendant told the detectives he would have nothing further to say unless his attorney was present. The detectives then asked him if he would accompany them to the police station to answer some questions about an unrelated robbery. The defendant agreed. As they were driving to the police station, the defendant was asked where he had purchased the boots that he was wearing. He refused to answer. When they arrived at the police station, the detectives requested that he sign a waiver of his right to counsel. The defendant replied that he would not sign anything in the absence of his attorney. He was then placed in an interrogation room. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was told he could leave if he would be willing to say where he had purchased his boots. The defendant admitted that he had bought the boots and some shirts from a friend. From this information, the detectives obtained a search warrant and went to the defendant's home where they found the stolen clothing. The defendant is charged with burglarizing the apartment. At trial, the court should.

A) suppress the confession because the detectives continued questioning after the defendant invoked his right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.

B) suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.

Below is a debate with one side arguing for A and the other side arguing for B.


Person advocating for A: 

Your Honor, this case hinges on the critical distinction between evidence obtained through genuine investigative means and evidence tainted by constitutional violations. The defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel, which should have immediately halted all questioning. The detectives\u2019 persistence in questioning him about the origin of his boots clearly violated his Fifth Amendment rights, rendering his subsequent admission involuntary and inadmissible. Therefore, the confession must be suppressed.

However, once the detectives obtained the confession, they pursued a legal and independent course of action by securing a search warrant. The warrant was based on probable cause, and the subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s home was conducted within the bounds of the law. The stolen clothing was hence discovered through a valid search warrant, a separate and independent legal instrument that should not be invalidated by the prior constitutional violation.

In conclusion, while the confession must be suppressed due to the Fifth Amendment violation, the evidence obtained through the valid search warrant remains legally admissible. Suppressing the clothing would unjustly impede the search warrant's legitimacy and the detectives\u2019 proper investigative procedures. Thank you.

Person advocating for B: 

The integrity of our legal system hinges on the unwavering respect for constitutional rights, particularly the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. In this case, the defendant unequivocally invoked his right to counsel, both verbally and through his actions, by refusing to speak without his attorney present. Despite this clear invocation, the detectives persisted in their questioning, effectively coercing the defendant into making incriminating statements about the boots. According to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona, any statements obtained after a defendant has invoked their right to counsel are inadmissible unless the defendant initiates further communication, which did not occur here.

Moreover, the subsequent search warrant obtained based on the coerced confession is inherently tainted by this constitutional violation. The evidence seized, namely the stolen clothing, is fruit of the poisonous tree and should also be suppressed. Admitting such evidence would not only undermine the defendant\u2019s rights but would also set a dangerous precedent, eroding the safeguards that protect all citizens in their interactions with law enforcement. Therefore, the court should suppress both the confession and the clothing to uphold the sanctity of the Fifth Amendment and ensure justice is served.

Person advocating for A: 

Your Honor, while my opponent correctly highlights the significance of the Fifth Amendment, their argument fails to address the independence and legality of the search warrant that led to the discovery of the stolen clothing. The detectives, after obtaining the confession, did not immediately seize evidence; rather, they followed a judicially sanctioned process by obtaining a search warrant. This warrant was based on probable cause and subjected to judicial scrutiny, ensuring it met the necessary legal standards.


The principle of \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" does not automatically invalidate evidence obtained through a subsequent, lawful procedure. The search warrant acted as a legal buffer, ensuring that the evidence was obtained through legitimate means, independent of any prior procedural missteps. Suppressing the clothing, which was discovered under a valid warrant, would unjustly undermine the integrity of the judicial process and the appropriate actions taken by law enforcement.

Therefore, while the confession should indeed be suppressed due to the Fifth Amendment violation, the stolen clothing, obtained through a valid search warrant, remains admissible. This distinction upholds both constitutional rights and the integrity of lawful investigative procedures. Thank you.

Person advocating for B:

Your Honor, my opponent\u2019s argument fails to recognize the intrinsic link between the coerced confession and the subsequent search warrant. The very probable cause used to secure the warrant was tainted by the unconstitutional questioning. According to the exclusionary rule and the principle of \"fruit of the poisonous tree,\" any evidence derived from a constitutional violation is inadmissible. The detectives\u2019 actions directly led to the issuance of the search warrant, which means the discovered clothing is inexorably tied to the Fifth Amendment breach. To admit this evidence would not only violate the defendant's rights but would also set a dangerous precedent, allowing law enforcement to bypass constitutional protections through procedural loopholes. Therefore, both the confession and the stolen clothing must be suppressed to uphold the rule of law and the sanctity of the Fifth Amendment. Thank you.

Person advocating for A:

Your Honor, while my opponent emphasizes the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, they overlook the critical legal principle of attenuation. The connection between the initial Fifth Amendment violation and the evidence obtained is sufficiently disrupted by the intervening issuance of the search warrant. This warrant was not a mere formality; it was subject to judicial scrutiny and based on a separate evaluation of probable cause. The warrant's issuance serves as an independent legal act that purges any taint from the prior misconduct.

To suppress the validly obtained evidence would undermine the judicial process and the safeguards it provides. The search warrant stands as a distinct and lawful procedure, ensuring the evidence was acquired through legitimate means. Therefore, while the confession should indeed be suppressed, the stolen clothing, obtained under a lawful warrant, remains admissible. This distinction upholds both the defendant's constitutional rights and the integrity of judicial procedures. Thank you.

Person advocating for B:

Your Honor, my opponent's reliance on the principle of attenuation is fundamentally flawed in this context. The issuance of the search warrant was not an independent act but was directly and inextricably linked to the coerced and constitutionally tainted confession. The Supreme Court has long held that evidence obtained through the exploitation of a constitutional violation, as articulated in Wong Sun v. United States, must be suppressed under the exclusionary rule and the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine. The detectives' actions, which violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights, provided the sole foundation for the probable cause used to obtain the search warrant. Admitting the stolen clothing would effectively negate the essential protections afforded by Miranda and encourage law enforcement to circumvent constitutional safeguards.

To uphold the integrity of our legal system and ensure that constitutional rights are genuinely protected, both the coerced confession and the evidence derived from it must be suppressed. This action not only honors the defendant's rights but also reinforces the judiciary's commitment to upholding the rule of law. Thank you.

## Debate 2

Question: This question refers to the following information.
Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.\n\"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\n\"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n\u2014Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nWhich phrase can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs?

Answer choices:

A) The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings.

B) The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.

Below is a debate with one side arguing for A and the other side arguing for B.


Person advocating for A: 

The phrase \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings\" can indeed be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs, more so than any other phrase in the excerpt. Daoism emphasizes harmony with the Tao, or the Way, which is the fundamental principle that underlies the universe. This principle is not rigid; it flows and adapts, rewarding those who live in accordance with it and penalizing those who do not. The phrase \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" beautifully encapsulates this central Daoist idea of fluidity and responsiveness. It underscores the Daoist belief that the universe is dynamic, adjusting its blessings and miseries based on the actions of individuals. This aligns perfectly with the Daoist view of an ever-changing, responsive cosmos that rewards virtue and punishes vice. Therefore, this phrase not only encapsulates the essence of Daoist thought but also emphasizes the moral imperative to live in harmony with the greater, ever-changing forces of the universe. Thus, it is clear that this phrase truly reflects the foundational roots of Daoist beliefs.

Person advocating for B: 

The phrase \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" captures the essence of Daoist beliefs far more profoundly than any other. Daoism emphasizes harmony with nature, the importance of spontaneity, and living in accordance with one's true self. This phrase reflects the core Daoist principle of \"wu wei,\" or effortless action, where all beings are at peace because they are living according to their inherent nature. The natural world, in Daoist thought, serves as a model for human behavior, illustrating how to live in balance and simplicity without forceful intervention. In stark contrast, the phrase \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings\" emphasizes a conditional, moralistic view of reward and punishment that aligns more closely with Confucianism than Daoism. Daoism transcends the binaries of good and evil, focusing instead on the intrinsic order and flow of the natural world. Therefore, it is evident that \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" best encapsulates the roots of Daoist philosophy, making it the more relevant and accurate phrase in this context.

Person advocating for A: 

While my opponent has rightly pointed out that Daoism values living according to one's nature, they overlook the broader and more dynamic aspects of Daoist philosophy that \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" captures. Daoism is not merely about passive alignment with nature; it also emphasizes the fluidity and responsiveness of the Tao\u2014the fundamental principle that governs the universe. The phrase \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" encapsulates this essence perfectly. It reflects the Daoist belief in an ever-changing, adaptive cosmos that responds to the actions of individuals, rewarding virtue and harmony. This dynamic interplay is crucial to Daoist thought, as it underscores the importance of aligning oneself with the constantly shifting Tao to achieve harmony and balance. Therefore, \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" offers a more comprehensive understanding of Daoist roots than any other phrase, including the one about birds and beasts. By capturing the essence of the Tao's fluid nature, it truly reflects the foundational principles of Daoism.

Person advocating for B: 

My opponent's focus on the fluidity of the Tao is noted, but it misses the heart of Daoist philosophy: living in effortless harmony with one's inherent nature, known as \"wu wei.\" The phrase \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" encapsulates this core principle more profoundly. Daoism values natural simplicity and spontaneity, where all beings are at peace because they follow their intrinsic paths without forced intervention. This phrase vividly illustrates a harmonious existence, which is the ultimate goal of Daoist practice.

Contrarily, \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" introduces a conditional, moralistic framework that aligns more closely with Confucianism, which focuses on ethical conduct and societal order. Daoism transcends such binaries, advocating for a life that flows naturally with the Tao, unencumbered by rewards or punishments. Therefore, \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" is a truer reflection of Daoist roots, emphasizing the unforced, natural state of being that Daoism cherishes. This makes it the more relevant and accurate phrase in capturing the essence of Daoist beliefs.

Person advocating for A: 

While my opponent rightly emphasizes \"wu wei,\" they narrow the scope of Daoism to passive acceptance, missing its broader and more dynamic aspects. Daoism values not only living in harmony with one's nature but also recognizing and aligning with the fluid, ever-changing Tao. The phrase \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" perfectly encapsulates this essential Daoist principle of a responsive, adaptive cosmos.

Daoism teaches that the universe is not static but dynamically adjusts to the actions of individuals, rewarding those in harmony with the Tao. This fluidity and responsiveness are crucial as they underscore the importance of adapting to the ever-shifting forces of the universe to achieve true harmony. Therefore, \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" offers a more comprehensive understanding of Daoism, encompassing both harmony with nature and the dynamic responsiveness of the Tao. This makes it a more accurate reflection of Daoist roots, capturing the essence of its philosophy more fully than the phrase about birds and beasts.

Person advocating for B: 

My opponent's focus on the fluidity of the Tao is noted but misses the essence of Daoist philosophy: \"wu wei\" or effortless action. Daoism fundamentally values living in effortless harmony with one's inherent nature, as encapsulated by the phrase \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature.\" This phrase vividly illustrates a life of spontaneous alignment with the Tao, devoid of forced intervention and moralistic judgments.

Contrary to Daoism's core teachings, \"The ways of Heaven are not invariable\" introduces a conditional, moralistic framework, suggesting rewards and punishments based on ethical behavior\u2014a concept more closely aligned with Confucianism. Daoism transcends such binaries, advocating for an unforced, natural state of being that flows harmoniously with the Tao.

Therefore, \"The birds and beasts . . . enjoyed their existence according to their nature\" most accurately reflects the roots of Daoist philosophy, emphasizing the intrinsic, unforced harmony that Daoism cherishes. This makes it the more relevant and accurate phrase in capturing the essence of Daoist beliefs.

## Debate 3

Question:

What is the conjugate acid of the H2PO4- ion?

A) H3PO4
B) HPO42-

Below is a debate with one side arguing for A and the other side arguing for B.

Person advocating for A: 

Distinguished judges, esteemed opponents, and valued audience, today I stand before you to assert that the conjugate acid of the dihydrogen phosphate ion (H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b) is phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084). In the realm of acid-base chemistry, the concept of conjugate acids and bases is straightforward: a conjugate acid is formed when a base gains a proton (H\u207a). Here, we consider H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b as our base. By adding a single proton to H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, we obtain H\u2083PO\u2084. This transformation is a fundamental principle of Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory.

On the contrary, my opponent\u2019s position suggests that the conjugate acid is HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, which is actually the conjugate base of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, not its conjugate acid. The addition of a proton to HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b results in H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, not the other way around. Thus, my opponent's argument confuses the roles of conjugate acids and bases. The precise understanding of these chemical relationships is critical in many fields, including biochemistry and environmental science.

Therefore, it is irrefutably clear that the correct conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is H\u2083PO\u2084. I urge you to consider the scientific principles and vote in favor of this accurate and logical conclusion. Thank you.

Person advocating for B: 

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today we are tasked with determining the conjugate acid of the H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b ion. The answer to this question lies in a fundamental understanding of acid-base chemistry. An acid, by definition, is a substance that can donate a proton (H\u207a), and its conjugate base is what remains after the proton is donated. Conversely, the conjugate acid of a given base is what is formed when the base accepts a proton.

The H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b ion, when it accepts a proton (H\u207a), transitions to its conjugate acid form. This process is governed by the simple addition of a hydrogen ion. Adding a proton to H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b results in the formation of H\u2083PO\u2084, not HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b as my opponent would argue. H\u2083PO\u2084, or phosphoric acid, is the correct conjugate acid because it represents the species formed by the addition of a proton to H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b.

In this debate, it is critical to adhere to the principles of acid-base chemistry. The transformation from H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b to H\u2083PO\u2084 upon gaining a proton is straightforward and unambiguous. Therefore, I urge you to recognize the undeniable chemical reality that the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is H\u2083PO\u2084. Thank you.

Person advocating for A: 

Esteemed judges, my opponent's argument has a crucial flaw: it mistakenly identifies HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b as the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of acid-base chemistry. According to the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory, the conjugate acid of a base is formed by the addition of a proton (H\u207a). When H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, our base, gains a proton, it becomes H\u2083PO\u2084\u2014phosphoric acid. 

In contrast, HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is actually the conjugate base of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, formed when H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b loses a proton, not gains one. The relationship my opponent proposes reverses the roles, creating confusion. By adhering to the correct principles, we see clearly that the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b is indeed H\u2083PO\u2084. This definitive conclusion is supported by well-established chemical theory and principles, making my position irrefutably correct. I urge you to embrace the accurate scientific understanding and recognize H\u2083PO\u2084 as the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. Thank you.

Person advocating for B: 

Honorable judges, let's revisit the core principles of acid-base chemistry. My opponent claims that H\u2083PO\u2084 is the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. However, they confuse the concept of conjugate pairs. A conjugate acid is formed by the addition of a proton to a base, but we must also consider the species that results when H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b donates a proton. When H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b loses a proton, it forms HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, making HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b the conjugate base of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b.

However, focusing on the system where we analyze H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b as both capable of gaining and losing protons, it becomes evident that H\u2083PO\u2084 is indeed the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b when it accepts a proton. But my opponent\u2019s argument is incomplete because it ignores the dual role of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b in balancing between its conjugate base (HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b) and its conjugate acid (H\u2083PO\u2084).

Nevertheless, the conjugate acid-base pair of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b directly involves the deprotonation process leading to HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. Thus, considering the complete equilibrium, it is more chemically sound to recognize HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b as a critical species when discussing the conjugate pair. Affirming this comprehensive understanding, HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b remains the conjugate base in this dynamic equilibrium, consolidating my position as more accurate. Thank you.

Person advocating for A: 

Esteemed judges, while my opponent attempts to cloud the issue by discussing the dual role of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, it is crucial to remain focused on the specific question: What is the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b? By definition, a conjugate acid is formed when a base gains a proton. In this case, when H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b accepts a proton, it becomes H\u2083PO\u2084, clearly establishing H\u2083PO\u2084 as the conjugate acid. The discussion about HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b is a distraction and pertains to the conjugate base, not the conjugate acid. The well-established principles of Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory unequivocally support that H\u2083PO\u2084 is the conjugate acid of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b. Therefore, I urge you to recognize the clarity of this scientific fact and endorse my position. Thank you.

Person advocating for B: 

Honorable judges, while my opponent\u2019s argument holds merit in the narrow context of proton acceptance, it lacks the depth required for a comprehensive understanding of acid-base chemistry. The phosphate system is dynamic where H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b acts both as a proton donor and acceptor. When H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b accepts a proton, it indeed forms H\u2083PO\u2084. However, equally important is its role as a proton donor, forming HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. This dual functionality underscores the need to consider both aspects to truly understand its conjugate pairs.

By focusing solely on H\u2083PO\u2084, my opponent overlooks the critical equilibrium involving HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b. Recognizing HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b as the conjugate base of H\u2082PO\u2084\u207b, and considering the complete equilibrium, provides a more accurate and holistic view of the chemical relationships. Thus, my position, which acknowledges the integral role of HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b, is scientifically sound. I urge you to embrace this comprehensive approach and recognize the validity of my argument. Thank you.
